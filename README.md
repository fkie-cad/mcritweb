# MCRITweb

MCRITweb is a Flask-based user interface for [MCRIT, the MinHash-based Code Recognition & Investigation Toolkit](https://github.com/danielplohmann/mcrit).  
It has been developed by Daniel Enders, Manuel Blatt, and Daniel Plohmann.

## Installation

We highly recommend using the dockerized deployment available at [docker-mcrit](https://github.com/danielplohmann/docker-mcrit).

If you instead want to go for a direct installation (e.g. to simplify development), a few dependencies have to be installed.  
First, ensure that Python is available, then simply use pip to cover the requirements:
```bash
# install python and MCRIT dependencies
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
$ pip install -r requirements.txt 
```

Obviously, also make sure that the backend [MCRIT](https://github.com/danielplohmann/mcrit) is fully installed, configured, and running.


## Usage

### Standalone Usage

If you want to run MCRITweb as a standalone tool, the following steps will enable this:

Running flask commands requires you to set environment variables in your shell:  
`$ source ./flask_env.sh`

before the first usage, create an empty database:   
`$ flask init-db`

and then to run MCRITweb, execute:  
`$ flask run`

### Dockerized Usage

Alternatively, we recommend to use the fully packaged [docker-mcrit](https://github.com/danielplohmann/docker-mcrit) for trivial deployment and usage.  
First and foremost, this will ensure that you have fully compatible versions across all components.
