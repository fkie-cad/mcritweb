"""The family-name type-ahead renders suggestions as HTML, so its data must be escaped.

`static/autocomplete.js` is vendored third-party code - byte-for-byte upstream
`gch1p/bootstrap-5-autocomplete` at 5ce977959b12, see AGENTS.md. Its `createItem`
builds each suggestion by interpolating the label and the value into an HTML string,
and `ce()` assigns that string to `innerHTML`. A family name is chosen by whoever
submits or renames a family, so a name that *is* markup becomes script the moment
someone opens the edit-family/edit-sample modal and types a matching character. Two
sinks, not one: the button's text content, and the `data-label`/`data-value`
attributes the same value is interpolated into unescaped.

`|tojson` at the two call sites protects the transport - the name reaches the browser
as a correct JS string - and that is all it protects. The sink is in JavaScript, one
`innerHTML` further on, and issue #85's ratchet in `testScriptEscaping.py` does not
reach it. AGENTS.md forbids patching a vendored asset, so the escaping is done where
the data is built: the templates hand the widget names that are already HTML-escaped.

That fix has a known, bounded cost, pinned below by
`test_the_highlighter_severs_an_entity` rather than left to a comment nobody rereads:
the widget slices the *escaped* label at offsets it measured in that same escaped
string, so a lookup straddling an entity splits it and the suggestion renders as
`R&amp;D` instead of `R&D`. Display only - the label is escaped either way, and
`data-label` still round-trips to the original - and it cannot be fixed from the call
site, because `item.label` (`autocomplete.js:110`) is the single value the matcher
(`:114`), the highlight index (`:70-72`), the rendered slices (`:75-77`) and the
attribute (`:90`) all read. See AGENTS.md for the full argument.

Four tests, deliberately not redundant:

`test_the_type_ahead_data_is_html_escaped` is offline and runs everywhere. It decodes
the JS string literals the page actually emits and asserts none of them still carries
raw markup - not just `<`, but `"` and `'` too, since `data-label="..."` is an
attribute and a bare quote there is an event handler.

`test_every_type_ahead_builds_its_data_through_the_escaping_filter` is the ratchet.
Escaping at the call site is only as good as the next call site, and it checks the
data *expression* rather than looking for the filter's name somewhere in the block -
a comment mentioning the filter used to be enough to satisfy it.

`test_a_family_name_cannot_execute_in_the_type_ahead` drives a real browser, because
the sink is a browser behaviour and no amount of reading the response proves it is
shut. Two payloads at once - one that opens a tag, one that breaks out of the
`data-label` attribute - and it asserts neither ran, both still read as text, the
prefix is still highlighted, and selecting one puts the *unescaped* name in the field.

`test_the_highlighter_severs_an_entity` is the honest record of the cost above.

The browser tests need playwright with a chromium build; without either they skip
rather than fail, so the offline pair is what CI is guaranteed to run.
