"""The Dropzone upload path - issue #27.

Flask-Dropzone was the recorded reason MCRITweb could not leave Flask 2.2.5, and it
was also the one integration nothing exercised: the suite rendered both dropzone
pages and asserted the CSRF header they emit, but no test ever posted a file through
one. That left the half of the path Werkzeug owns - multipart parsing, `request.files`,
the file wrapper handed to `json.load` - covered by nothing.

These tests drive the request the browser actually sends, so lifting the pin is
answered by the suite rather than by hand.
