"""The access policy of every route, written down so it can be asserted.

This module is data, not tests - `testRoutePolicy.py` reads it. It is deliberately
not named `test*.py` so pytest does not collect it.

**What is recorded here is what the app does today**, derived by exercising every
route in `app.url_map` as each role and observing whether the request was admitted
or rejected. It is a baseline to review and argue with, not a statement that the
current behaviour is correct. Where the observed behaviour looks wrong, the row
carries a comment rather than a corrected value - change the value only together
with the code, so the test stays a description of reality.

Two facts per route:

`role`    the least privileged caller that gets past the gate. Authorization is
          settled before the view body runs, so this is observable without any
          backend or fixture data.

`writes`  whether the view changes state - the local SQLite database or the MCRIT
          backend - and, crucially, whether a plain GET is enough to do it. See
          issue #84. CSRF tokens now cover every unsafe method (issue #83), but a
          token cannot cover a route that writes on GET: a browser sends no token
          on a plain navigation, so every WRITES_ON_GET row is still reachable
          from any page a logged-in user visits, e.g. through an <img> tag.

Adding a route means adding a row here; `testRoutePolicy.py` fails on any endpoint
in the url_map that is missing, and on any row naming an endpoint that no longer
exists.

# visit by a given user. It is idempotent and not caller-controlled, so the write
# detector seeds those rows up front rather than treating each page as a writer.
