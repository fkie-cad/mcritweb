"""Deleting and promoting happens by POST only - issue #84.

These routes took a GET, which means anything that makes a browser fetch a URL could
fire them: an <img> tag in a mail or an issue comment, a link scanner, a prefetch.
No form, no JavaScript, no click. An admin merely loading a page could be made to
promote an account or delete a user.

The maintenance jobs are here for the same reason. They were already POST forms in
admin_server.html, but the routes accepted GET as well, so the form was a convention
rather than a constraint.

This closes the vector where an attacker picks the request. It does not close CSRF:
a forged POST still works, because nothing in this application emits a token yet.
See issue #83.
