          `content`, `family_mapping` and `sample_entries` unguarded, so a missing key
          is a KeyError, a non-dict `config` a TypeError, and both are a 500 - which

          401 that `handle_response` has no branch for at all;
        * any other backend failure, down to the database being unreachable.
