"""What the explore pages ask the backend for, and what they still show for it.

Issue #77 is "searching for samples is slow". Two of the three backend calls behind
`/explore/samples` have nothing to do with the query: the view downloaded the whole
job queue to annotate at most 25 rows, and the whole family table to fill a
type-ahead in a modal nobody had opened. A queue and a family table both grow
monotonically with instance use, so both cost more on exactly the instances where
the complaint comes from.

Issue #76 is the neighbouring one: `/explore/search` fans out to all three
collections, and the function search is the slow one - ~30 seconds on a large
database, worst when it finds nothing. That cost is mcrit's to fix; what is fixable
here is who is charged for it.

These tests are call counts, and they are paired deliberately with assertions on what
the page still renders. Narrowing a fetch is only a fix while the annotation it fed
survives - a listing that quietly stops showing which samples have matching jobs is a
regression, not an improvement, and a search that quietly stops looking at functions
is one too.
