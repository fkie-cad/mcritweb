"""Which result templates are actually rendered by the suite, and by what.

Issue #99: `testResultPages.py` covered five report types, asserting HTTP 200 and the
absence of an error template. That proves a template compiles and that data reached it;
it cannot see a template that is never rendered at all, and eight of the eighteen
result/job templates were in that position.

This file measures coverage rather than assuming it. `flask.template_rendered` reports
what Flask actually rendered for a request, so `RENDERED_BY` below is checked against
the app's own behaviour, and `test_every_result_template_is_accounted_for` fails when a
new template appears with no entry - which is the ratchet the issue asks for, rather
than a one-time sweep that rots.

Two bugs fell out of writing it, both fixed in the same change and both invisible to a
status-code assertion:

  * the cross-compare custom-order path passed `job_info=result_json` - the result dict,
    not the Job - so `result_corrupted.html` rendered an empty job id and a "Delete job
    data" link built from nothing.
  * `result_compare_function.html` printed "Showing matches against family:
    {{ matching_result.getFamilyNameByFamilyId(famid) }}" while `famid` was never passed
    to it, and the page is filtered by *function* across all families anyway.
