"""The user manual is served from its markdown source, and only from there - #91.

It used to exist twice: `docs/manual/README.md` for readers on GitHub, and a
hand-written Jinja duplicate for `/help` in the running app, with nothing keeping
them in agreement. The screenshots were stored twice for the same reason. An edit
to either copy silently diverged from the other, and the in-app copy is the one
users actually see.

Most of what is worth asserting here is that the second copy has not come back, so
several of these tests read the repository rather than a response.
