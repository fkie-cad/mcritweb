"""Values crossing into JavaScript must be escaped for a script context.

Two tests with different reach, and they are not redundant:

`test_no_safe_filter_inside_a_script_block` is a lint over the template tree. It is the
ratchet issue #85 asked for - `|safe` disables autoescaping, and Jinja's autoescaping is
*HTML* escaping anyway, which is not what a `<script>` body needs. `|tojson` is the only
filter that escapes correctly there, and it is what AGENTS.md mandates. The lint exists
because the alternative is an exception list in the documentation that grows back.

`test_a_family_name_cannot_break_out_of_a_script_string` is a render, and it is the one
that would have caught the actual bug: family names are backend data, a contributor
chooses them, and two templates dropped them into a quoted JS string literal. A lint
alone would not have shown that the value was attacker-controlled rather than an id.
