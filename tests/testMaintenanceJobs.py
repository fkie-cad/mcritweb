"""The maintenance jobs mcrit 1.9.0 added, and the admin page that can now start them.

`repairMinHashes`, `recomputeFamilyStats` and `rebuildPicBlockHashIndex` are the repairs
for the three things `/status` reports as broken - samples an older smda escaper hashed,
drifted family counters, and the picblockhash index `getUniqueBlocks` reads. Until now
MCRITweb could report all three and start none of them: the server page offers
`rebuildIndex` and `recalculateMinHashes` and nothing else, so an operator had to reach
past the interface to the backend.

Three things had to line up for that to work, and each of them is a separate way to get it
wrong: the route has to queue the job, `data.result()` has to recognise the job type (its
list of maintenance parameters is hand-written, and a job not in it is reported as an
invalid job id), and the template has to render the report rather than "Unhandled
maintenance job type".
