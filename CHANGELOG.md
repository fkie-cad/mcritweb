# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) over what a deployment sees:
the routes, the configuration keys in `instance/config.py`, and the SQLite schema. A release that
changes the schema, adds a dependency or changes a default that affects an existing deployment says
so in its entry, under **Upgrading**, because MCRITweb is deployed from a checkout and a pull that
only brings code is not the release that was tested.

Add your entry to `[Unreleased]` when the change merges, while the reasoning is still at hand,
rather than reconstructing it from the commit log at release time.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Pushing a `vX.Y.Z` tag now cuts the release. The workflow refuses to continue unless the tag
  matches `pyproject.toml`, `CHANGELOG.md` has a section for it, the commit is on `master` and CI
  passed there; it then builds the sdist and wheel, checks their metadata, installs the wheel into a
  clean environment to prove the templates, static assets and schema ship with the package, and
  creates the GitHub release from that version's changelog section with the generated contributor
  list appended and the artifacts attached. Nothing is published to PyPI: MCRITweb is deployed from
  a checkout. Pre-release tags (`v1.5.0rc1`) are marked as such. See `RELEASING.md`.
- A pull request that changes `mcritweb/` or `pyproject.toml` has to add a `CHANGELOG.md` entry or
  carry the `no-changelog` label; CI checks it.

### Changed

- Packaging metadata moved from `setup.py` to `pyproject.toml` (PEP 621), which is now the only
  place the version is declared: the running version shown on the server page and stored in the
  `server` table is read from it, through `get_mcritweb_version()`. `ruff.toml` and `pytest.ini`
  folded into the same file. `requirements.txt` stays, for `docker-mcrit` and anyone installing
  from a checkout without building the package, and a test keeps it identical to the declared
  dependencies. **Upgrading:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` still works; `pip install -e .`
  is now equivalent, and `pip install -e ".[dev]"` brings the test and lint tooling, which used
  to arrive as a side effect of `mcrit` and no longer does since MCRIT 1.8.0.
- The release history moved out of `README.md` into this file; the entries below are unchanged.

## [1.5.0] - 2026-09-21

Written for the README's version history, where it was published, and kept as it was.

Forty-six merged pull requests, including four security fixes, three new database migrations and the function comparison view. **Four changes affect existing deployments, and the first two need an operator decision.** *(1)* The schema gains three things on first start, through idempotent migrations that alter nothing existing: a `login_attempt` table, a `query_upload` table, and user timestamps rewritten as explicit UTC (#98). No operator action beyond restarting. *(2)* **Deployments behind a reverse proxy need one setting**: `TRUSTED_PROXY_COUNT` in `instance/config.py`, the number of proxies in front of the app. `/login` and `/register` now meter failed attempts per source address over a fifteen-minute window, so password and registration-token guessing is no longer unmetered (#101); without the setting the throttle keys on the proxy's address, so ten failed logins from anywhere refuse everyone's next login and nothing is metered per attacker. It is never per account, because a per-account lockout would let anyone deny service to any account whose name they know. The default is `0` - served directly, no request header trusted - since trusting `X-Forwarded-For` uninvited would let a caller choose their own throttle key. *(3)* Query uploads are filed under the backend-issued job id instead of a sha256 taken from the uploaded report, so **every file already in `instance/temp/uploads/` is orphaned** and can be deleted, and a query made before this upgrade cannot be promoted to a sample - its result page reports the file as no longer available. *(4)* An `.smda` report declaring a malformed sha256 is now accepted rather than refused with 400, because nothing on that path reads the field any more. **The four security fixes.** Any visitor could destroy another user's stored query: the upload filename came from a sha256 the uploader types, written with no existence check, so naming an upload after someone else's query overwrote it permanently (#169). A family name was rendered as HTML by the type-ahead, and family names are chosen by whoever submits or renames a family - the vendored `autocomplete.js` assigns its suggestions through `innerHTML`, so both the button text and the `data-label`/`data-value` attributes were live sinks; escaping now happens once, in `mcritweb/autocomplete.py`, and a test fails on any call site fed data that filter did not build (#168). Submit metadata was concatenated into the backend's query string unescaped (#170). And `/analyze/query` let a visitor choose where its upload was written (#104, superseded on the same route by #169). Alongside them, `/login` no longer reports "Incorrect username" and "Incorrect password" separately, which had confirmed whether an account exists one request at a time (#101), and API tokens come from `secrets.token_hex` rather than `md5(uuid4().bytes)` - the entropy was always UUID4's so no existing token was weak, and existing tokens stay valid, but MD5 in an auth path is a finding every auditor writes up (#100). **New capability.** The function page gains sections and a synchronised, combinable comparison of two functions, with a BinDiff-style combined graph, linked block highlighting and a reset for the two panes, which are fitted independently and so start at different scales (#34, #74); loop and cycle highlighting works there too (#69), a single function can be analyzed instead of its parent sample (#35), and the CFG view survives a function stored without an xcfg (part of #67). Unique Blocks gets a page of its own with a sample set and rule knobs (#93). A query can be promoted to a stored sample (#9). Results export as raw JSON (#75), an import says what it is doing while it does it (#66), a paginated page shows a spinner while it loads (#60), a listing remembers the sort order it was last viewed with (#58), and a job shows the MinHash setting it was submitted with (#32). **Fixes.** The explore pages stopped downloading the whole job queue and every family on every view (#77). Five server errors are gone: the job overview with a deleted sub-job, the jobs page for a category with no jobs, `/data/jobs` when the backend will not summarize the queue, any paginated page carrying a query parameter named after one of `url_for()`'s own arguments, and a link hunt for a report that has none. A valid MCRIT export refused for a shingler or minhash configuration mismatch no longer claims to be malformed JSON, which sent the reader looking at their file rather than at the two instances' configurations (#167). The sample-filtered result page paginated a different list from the one it drew. Seven `print()` calls were removed from request paths, one of them dumping a whole 1-vs-1 match report to stdout (#165). A search hit is listed once when it is also the id match (#78), a listing page finds what the search page finds (part of #56), a search that matched nothing says so (#54), a hash lookup is answered rather than apologised for (#79), column headings and row buttons stay on one line (#52), scripts no longer leak their variables onto `window` (#61), and the navbar icons are no longer blank on first paint (#62). **Packaging and docs.** `python_requires` declares `>=3.11`, which was always true and never stated - it is inherited from mcrit's own floor, so an install on 3.10 previously failed with a resolver error naming neither Python nor the version the reader needed (#166). The manual's lists render as lists on `/help` again: nine of them followed a paragraph with no blank line between, which GitHub renders and Python-Markdown does not, so they had been coming out as one paragraph of literal asterisks. Six issues that cannot be solved in MCRITweb are now recorded where the next reader will look rather than rediscovered (#37, #47, #48, #57, #59, #72). Adds 729 tests, for **968 in total**. Six of them drive a real browser through Playwright - five proving the type-ahead escaping end to end, one the function comparison view - and they skip unless Playwright is installed, which CI does not yet do; they are currently the only automated check that the `innerHTML` sink in #168 stays closed.

## Older releases

Recorded as they were written in the README at the time, newest first.

 * 2026-08-10 v1.4.8: Hardening, plus one bug older than the issue that found it. **One change affects existing deployments:** the session cookie is now `Secure`, so it is only sent over HTTPS. The reference `docker-mcrit` deployment terminates TLS in NGINX and is unaffected, and a local `flask run` is unaffected because the flag is off while `FLASK_DEBUG` is set - but an instance served over plain HTTP in production will not be able to log in until `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE = False` is set in `instance/config.py`. Values crossing into JavaScript are now escaped for a script context (#85). That issue named eight `|safe` sites; there were fifteen, because a search for `|safe` does not find `| safe`, and two of the seven it missed were a real injection rather than hardening: family names went into a quoted JavaScript string literal on the family, sample and submit pages, so a family named with a quote in it could run script in another user's browser. Family names are chosen by whoever submits or renames a family, and are not validated here. Two new request-size ceilings, both configurable: `MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH` (1 GiB, enough for a whole-corpus import) makes an oversized body a 413 before it is buffered, where previously there was no limit at all; and `QUERY_UPLOAD_LIMITS` replaces the 1 MiB visitor cap that was hardcoded in `analyze.query`, as a `{role: bytes}` mapping with the same default (#19). Cross compare works again from the sample selection page: the sample list was built by joining two halves with a comma, so an empty half left a leading or trailing one, which `/analyze/start_cross_compare` has refused since v1.4.5 - it reported "select at least one sample" on a page where samples were plainly selected. The API passthrough's router branches are anchored, so a path merely *beginning* with a known one no longer dispatches to it, and it no longer prints the caller's username to stdout on every request. Adds 34 tests, for 239 in total.
 * 2026-08-07 v1.4.7: Lifts the Flask and Werkzeug pins that had held the project on a 2023 release (#27) - now `flask>=3.0` and `werkzeug>=3.0`, resolved against Flask 3.1.3 and Werkzeug 3.1.8. **Dependencies changed, so `pip install -r requirements.txt` has to be re-run and a container image rebuilt against this tag** - a deployment that pulls only code keeps the old Flask and is not running what this release was tested as. No application code needed changing to accommodate the upgrade. Python 3.13 and 3.14 join the CI matrix; 3.14 had been unreachable because Flask 2.2.5 calls `pkgutil.get_loader`, removed there. Two fixes to the upload paths, both older than this release: `/data/import` returned a server error for a file that was not JSON, or was JSON but not an object, and now reports it the way the completion page already did; and dropping an `.smda` report on the submit dropzone filled the base address but never family or version, because smda writes reports sorted and indented, which puts `metadata` past the 1024-byte window the browser sends - the browser now also sends a window cut from around `metadata`. Adds 14 tests over the upload paths, which nothing had exercised further than "the page renders", for 205 in total. Also points the Makefile at pytest and ruff instead of nose and pylint, and drops a deprecated positional `re.sub` count.
 * 2026-08-06 v1.4.6: **This release adds a dependency - `markdown` - so `pip install -r requirements.txt` has to be re-run, and a container image has to be rebuilt against this tag.** The app imports it at startup, so an environment that skips this will not boot. Fixes a crash that took down `/explore/search` for any query matching a sample, which had been there since the search page was written. Three more server errors fixed: editing a family or a sample with an empty form, and `/data/specific_export/<type>/<id>` for any type other than `family` or `samples`. The user manual is no longer maintained twice - `docs/manual/README.md` is the only copy and `/help` renders it, so the two can no longer drift, and the screenshots are stored once instead of twice (#91). It also now documents LinkHunt and Unique Blocks, neither of which had been described anywhere (#92).
 * 2026-08-06 v1.4.5: Bugfixes, no feature changes. **One affects results you may already have looked at:** cross compare passed the "only selected samples" checkbox to the backend as a string, and `"false"` is truthy, so an unticked box silently ran group-only matching - a different comparison from the one requested. The same bug set `force_recalculation` on nearly every job submission, which is why a repeated or double-clicked comparison queued a duplicate instead of reusing the finished job the backend already had (#97). Three crashes fixed: `/analyze/start_cross_compare` with no samples, or with a non-numeric sample list (#94); changing the role of a user who no longer exists, or to a role that does not exist (#95); and a 1-vs-1 or filtered result page whose matched functions have since been deleted, which now shows the "results are corrupted" page the cross-compare view already used instead of a server error (#96). That page's "Delete job data" button also worked again - it had pointed at a route that became POST-only in v1.4.3.
 * 2026-08-06 v1.4.4: Closes the CSRF hole (#83). Every state-changing request now needs a token bound to the session, so a page on another site can no longer act with a logged-in user's privileges - deleting samples or families, repointing the MCRIT backend, promoting an account or changing a password. **Two changes affect existing deployments:** `SECRET_KEY` no longer defaults to `'dev'` - an unset key is generated once and kept in `instance/secret_key`, which logs everyone out on the first start after upgrading; and the session cookie is now `SameSite=Lax`. Operators who set `SECRET_KEY` in `instance/config.py` are unaffected, and that remains the right answer for a multi-host deployment. Adds 38 tests and `docs/adr/0002-hand-rolled-csrf.md`, which records why the check is hand-rolled today and how it is meant to become `flask-wtf` when the Flask pin lifts (#27).
 * 2026-08-06 v1.4.3: Hardening and test foundation, no feature changes. **Four changes affect existing usage:** deleting a user, changing a role, deleting a job and the three maintenance jobs now require POST, so they can no longer be fired by anything that merely makes a browser fetch a URL; the API passthrough applies the role behind the token, refusing `pending` accounts entirely and requiring contributor to add a report; cached match diagrams need a session; and the documentation moved from `/admin/help` to `/help`. Fixed along the way: the settings page returned a server error after changing a username, password or default filter, an unconfirmed server reset raised instead of answering, and `/settings` carried an authorization decorator that never ran. Also adds an offline test suite (82 tests, no backend required) plus ruff and GitHub Actions CI.
 * 2026-08-04 v1.4.2: Adjusted for mcrit >= 1.5.3, where a matching report shares its entry objects between the full and the filtered match lists: the match diagram renderer no longer writes the negated query-report function_id back onto those shared entries, which would have corrupted the function_ids of query report tables. Also fixed a missing comma that merged the fastcluster and networkx requirements into one invalid entry.
 * 2025-12-10 v1.4.1: Can now start cross jobs where only selected samples are matched among each other (faster), minor fixes
 * 2025-12-09 v1.4.0: Customizable column setup for all tables per user, QoL improvements for cross jobs (start from SHA256 list, edit meta data in results view), minor fixes

 * 2025-07-30 v1.3.5: Documentation now available within MCRITweb, links to search syntax besides the search fields. Function 1v1 shows match score.
 * 2025-01-21 v1.3.4: Fixed a bug in the job overview, where in-progress cross compare jobs would cause a server error (500)
