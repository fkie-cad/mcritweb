    cursor is applied, and attaches them to every page it answers - in
    `MinHashIndex.getFamilySearchResults` and its two siblings the lookup runs at the
    top of the method and the assignment happens after `_getSearchResultTemplate` has
    already windowed the text hits, so the value is cursor-independent. Prepending it
    unconditionally therefore repeated one row, exact-match badge and all, on page 2,
    3, 4 ... of a listing.

    First page only, rather than de-duplicating: a view renders a single page and has
    no memory of the ones before it, so there is nothing here to de-duplicate against
    - the check would have to live in the browser or in a session. And the placement
    only means anything on the first page anyway: "the record you named, at the top"
    is a statement about the top of the listing, not about the top of whichever page
    the reader happened to walk to.

    The prepended row is over and above `limit`, so a first page can carry limit+1
    rows. Dropping a text hit to make room would hide that hit for good: mcrit builds
    the forward cursor from the last entry it returned (`_getSearchResultTemplate`),
    so the next page resumes *after* the row we dropped rather than at it. Issue #56
    is about a listing hiding a record that exists; trading one hidden record for
    another would be no fix. The exact hit is an answer to the query rather than a
    member of the paged result set, so it sits outside the page budget.
