    above "0.0.0", which is checked against a field the upload itself carries, so it holds

    Everything else is a guess, and has to read like one. `handle_response` collapses 500,
    501, 400, 404, 410 *and* every status it does not branch on - falcon's AuthMiddleware
    answers a bad or missing apitoken with a 401 - into the same `None` the config refusals
    produce, and the index also raises its way to a 500 on any JSON object that is not an
    export, since it reads `content`, `family_mapping` and `sample_entries` unguarded. The
    two config hashes are the likeliest cause by far and the backend does not publish its own
    to compare against (`GET /config` is HTTP_NOT_IMPLEMENTED), so they are named as likely,
