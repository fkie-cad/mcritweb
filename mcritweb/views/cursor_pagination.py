# page that can make a browser fetch a URL. Those tables hold preferences a user
# submits through a form (a POST); this is incidental view state, closer to a scroll
# position, and it costs a signed cookie rather than a write per page view. The
# trade-off is that it does not follow a user to another browser and does not survive
# clearing cookies, which for a table order is a much smaller loss than a GET writer.

        There are two ways to be on it and both have to count. A fresh URL carries
        no cursor at all. Paging *back* to it carries the backward cursor the second
        page handed out - `get_link("backward")`, which is what both the previous
        arrow and the "page 1" number link in table/pagination_widget.html emit - so
        "has no cursor" answers False for a page 1 the reader walked back to. A
        listing that drops the exact hit on the way back is issue #56 in mirror
        image: the record you searched for, gone from a page that showed it a moment
        earlier, under the same page number.

        The backend cannot answer this for us. `MinHashIndex._getSearchResultTemplate`
        sets a backward cursor for *any* request that carried one and returned rows,
        so `hasBackward` is true on a first page reached backwards; mcrit's cursor
        protocol has no "you are at the start" signal.

        `page` is this class's own bookkeeping, decremented by
        `_direction_to_page_num` on every backward link and carried in the query
        string, and it is the only thing that survives that round trip. It does not
        drive the query, and a hand-edited `?page=1&cursor=...` can lie about it -
        but the cost of that lie is one extra row for a record that does match the
        query, never a hidden one, and hiding is the failure this whole issue is
        about. `cursor["first"]` stays None so the "first" link is genuinely
