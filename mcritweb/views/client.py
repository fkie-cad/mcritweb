"""Single construction point for the MCRIT backend client.

Views call get_client() rather than building a McritClient themselves. That gives
tests one place to substitute a fake backend - via the MCRIT_CLIENT_FACTORY config
key - instead of patching the McritClient name in every view module, and it
collapses the repeated per-view ServerInfo lookups into one instance per request.

See issue #88.
