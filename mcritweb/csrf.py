"""Session-bound CSRF protection for cookie-authenticated requests.

Every state-changing route in this application authenticates through the session
cookie, which the browser attaches to *any* request it makes - including one a
third-party page triggered. `POST`-only (issue #84) stops a prefetch or an `<img>`
tag from firing a write, but it does not stop a form on an attacker's page from
submitting to us with the victim's cookie. This module is what stops that: a random
token minted per session, echoed by every form, and required on every unsafe method.

The public surface deliberately matches the part of `flask-wtf`'s `CSRFProtect` this
application would use - the `csrf_token()` template global, the `csrf_token` form
field, the `X-CSRFToken` header, and `exempt()`. The Flask pin that made adopting the
extension awkward was lifted in issue #27, so that swap is now unblocked (ADR-0002);
keeping the names identical makes it an import change instead of a sweep through
every template again.

What the real extension adds, and this does not: signed and time-limited tokens, a
referrer check on HTTPS, and per-response token variation. None of them are the
primary defence, which is why this is a reasonable stop-gap rather than a permanent
answer.

Token strength rests on the session cookie's signature, so it rests on `SECRET_KEY`.
See `mcritweb.secret_key`.
