# Hand-roll CSRF, shaped so flask-wtf can replace it

---
status: accepted — intended to be replaced, see #27

Issue #83 needed CSRF protection. The obvious answer is `flask-wtf`'s `CSRFProtect`,
and it is the right long-term answer. We wrote `mcritweb/csrf.py` instead, roughly
sixty lines: a random token per session, a `before_request` check on every method
that is not `GET`/`HEAD`/`OPTIONS`/`TRACE`, and an `exempt()` for `/api`.

Two reasons, in order of weight:

1. **Flask is hard-pinned at 2.2.5** (ADR-0001). Adding a dependency that has to
   resolve against a 2023 Flask, when the plan is to lift that pin in #27, means
   pinning `flask-wtf` too and then moving both. The extension is easier to adopt
   *after* the upgrade than before it.
2. **`wtforms` comes along for nothing.** This application builds no WTForms forms
   and would gain none; `CSRFProtect` is the only part of the package it wants.

None of that is an argument that hand-rolled is better. It is an argument about
sequencing.

## What makes the swap cheap

The module deliberately mirrors the public surface of `CSRFProtect` rather than
inventing its own:

| Ours | flask-wtf |
| --- | --- |
| `csrf_token()` template global | same name |
| `csrf_token` form field | `WTF_CSRF_FIELD_NAME` default |
| `X-CSRFToken` / `X-CSRF-Token` headers | same |
| `WTF_CSRF_ENABLED` config key | same |
| `CsrfProtect(app)`, `.exempt(view_or_blueprint)` | `CSRFProtect(app)`, `.exempt(...)` |
| `app.extensions["csrf"]` | same |

So adopting the extension is: delete `mcritweb/csrf.py`, change two imports in the
app factory, add the dependency. **No template changes, no JavaScript changes, no
test changes.** The last row is what makes Flask-Dropzone work — it refuses to send
a token unless it finds a protector under `app.extensions["csrf"]`, and it will find
either one.

## Consequences

What the extension provides and this does not, none of it the primary defence:

- tokens are raw session values, not signed and time-limited — so a token is valid
  for the life of the session, and identical on every page of it;
- no referrer check on HTTPS requests;
- no per-response token variation, which is a partial mitigation for BREACH.

The token's strength rests on the session cookie's signature, and so on
`SECRET_KEY`. Fixing the `'dev'` default (`mcritweb/secret_key.py`) was part of the
same change for that reason: without it, an attacker who can forge a session can put
whatever token they like inside it, and none of the above matters.

`SESSION_COOKIE_SAMESITE = "Lax"` is set as defence in depth. It is not a substitute
— it still permits a top-level `GET`, which is exactly what the routes tracked in
issue #97 are vulnerable to.
